More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Today, we are increasingly known as “the AI computing company”. We are looking to grow our company, and grow with the smartest people in the world. We are looking for you.</p> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>you’ll </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>doing:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Design, develop and deploy next-generation horizontally scalable multi-tenant SDN network architecture (starting with Distributed Stateful Firewalls for Bare-Metal and K8s Clouds at scale). The OVS/OVN-based SDN Firewalls will be offloaded to Nvidia Smart NICs.</p> </li> <li> <p>To complement the efficient networking architecture, you will help crafting Infrastructure-as-a-Service for networking that can provision performant virtual networks on-demand to provide support for VMs and containers in multi-tenant environment. This service will provide easy-to-use high-level abstractions for the users, via Cloud APIs. You will also help to build vendor-neutral access layers for automated configurations of networking infrastructure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also, design and develop software for monitoring the overall network health for effective operations. The intelligence needs to be build into the system for tracking and regulating usage by various tenants, analyzing it and taking appropriate actions.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>we </strong><strong>need </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>see:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>BA/BS degree in Computer Science or related technical discipline or equivalent experience (MS preferred).</p> </li> <li> <p>10+ years of experience in host and infrastructure networking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deep understanding of various networking protocols with hands-on kernel development experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hands-on experience with Open Virtual Switch (or an equivalent solution).</p> </li> <li> <p>Expertise in Unix networking stack and networking drivers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Experience in crafting network architecture for cloud/distributed systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hands-on experience with large-scale network setups and device(switches/routers etc.) configurations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Understanding of SR-IOV and KVM virtualization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hands-on experience with one or more SDN solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Experience in network management systems, network monitoring systems or network operations.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Ways </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>stand </strong><strong>out </strong><strong>from </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>crowd:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Experience with RDMA (InfiniBand or RoCE) fabrics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Understanding of container networking (networking for Kubernetes, Docker, etc).</p> </li> <li> <p>Coding skills in scripting languages like Python.</p> </li> <li> <p>Working knowledge of databases and data structures.</p> </li> </ul> <p>NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers.

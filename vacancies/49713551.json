Each BU is responsible for dozens of services, in total we have 100+ applications interacting with each other. Software architects keep the whole system in a good shape in terms of BUs’ and services’ zones of responsibility and data flows and provide strategic vision of the system evolution. They also are the ones who have The Big Picture of the system, keep an eye on it and track every significant change.</li> <li><strong>Inter BU architectural activities.</strong> Within a business unit software architects keep engineers informed about significant changes in other units, make sure solutions proposed by engineers address existing non functional requirements and keep technical health of the system. In other words the role implies an active part in the development process but not necessarily from an execution perspective, we want software architects to challenge the current solutions and to be able to drill into details.</li> <li><strong>One time activities “in the field”.</strong> Architects as a part of business unit tech staff are expected to support important agendas if needed. Could it be taking part in development of a feature in order to help a product team to meet a deadline, or presentation of financial data flows to external auditors.

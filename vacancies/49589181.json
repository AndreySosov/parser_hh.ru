It provides core services such as Offers search list, Offer Creation Wizard, Trade chat, Offers Approval, Payment Methods such as Bank Transfer, Gift Cards and so on. It was built as a monolith adding more and more features into the same codebase. At some moment we came to the decision to start splitting the monolith and creating microservices. The goal is to provide microservices which enable development of new products outside of monolith without a need to have coupling with it. This is a long complex project continuously bringing new challenges to the team from different sides: high load, integration between services, data synchronisation, independency from 3rd-party services, transparent navigation, etc.<br /><br /><strong>What we appreciate:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> As colleagues, we take care of each other and help to achieve the best results;</li> <li><strong>Proactive attitude:</strong> We’re willing and ready to roll up our sleeves and take responsibility;</li> <li><strong>Self-direction:</strong> We figure out solutions on our own and take charge of carrying them out;</li> </ul> <p><strong>An adaptive mindset:</strong> We shift our processes, perspectives, and working styles along with the environment.<br /><br /><strong>As a key member of our team, your responsibilities will entail:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Design, develop and perform functional, integrational test cases;</li> <li>Write and keep up-to-dated test specifications / test suites in TestRail TMS;</li> <li>Develop E2E auto tests written on PHP, Selenium, PHP-WebDriver;</li> <li>Perform bugs analysis, RCA and build the preventing strategy;</li> <li>Improve tests and code coverage (SonarQube);</li> <li>Build and run performance and security checks;</li> <li>Collaborate and work closely with developers and product managers;</li> <li>Analyse and process customer’s feedback, perform troubleshooting on both STG and Production env;</li> <li>Create the detailed bug reports in Jira attaching system, product logs and debug information.<br /><br /><strong>Requirements:</strong></li> <li>3+ years of proven experience as a QA Engineer and solid knowledge of QA methodologies and testing strategies;</li> <li>Hands-on experience with writing automatic unit and E2E tests using Selenium;</li> <li>Experience with tools such as TestRail, Allure, Gitlab, SonarQube, JIRA, Confluence, JMeter, CI/CD, Grafana;</li> <li>Experience with testing of web, mobile, API;</li> <li>Experience with Postgres and MongoDB;</li> <li>Strong communication skills;</li> <li>Confident verbal and written English.<br /><br /><strong>Ideally, you’ll also have:</strong></li> <li>Knowledge of crypto currency, financial markets, banking or exchanges;</li> <li>K8s &amp; docker;</li> <li>Experience with AWS.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits:</strong></li> <li>Working at an international, fast-growing company;</li> <li>Competitive salary;</li> <li>Ability to work remotely;</li> <li>The latest tech equipment (MacBooks, etc.);</li> <li>Employment as an IE (USD salary) or an official employment (according to Russian labour law).</li> </ul>","branded_description":null,"vacancy_constructor_template":null,"key_skills":[{"name":"Английский язык"},{"name":"TestRail"},{"name":"PHPUnit"},{"name":"QA"},{"name":"MongoDB"},{"name":"Selenium"},{"name":"Manual Testing"},{"name":"Test Automation"}],"accept_handicapped":false,"accept_kids":false,"archived":false,"response_url":null,"specializations":[{"id":"1.117","name":"Тестирование","profarea_id":"1","profarea_name":"Информационные технологии, интернет, телеком"}],"professional_roles":[{"id":"124","name":"Тестировщик"}],"code":"229","hidden":false,"quick_responses_allowed":false,"driver_license_types":[],"accept_incomplete_resumes":false,"employer":{"id":"5173025","name":"Paxful","url":"https://api.hh.ru/employers/5173025?host=hh.ru","alternate_url":"https://hh.ru/employer/5173025","logo_urls":{"240":"https://hhcdn.ru/employer-logo/3696060.png","90":"https://hhcdn.ru/employer-logo/3696059.png","original":"https://hhcdn.ru/employer-logo-original/813793.png"},"vacancies_url":"https://api.hh.ru/vacancies?employer_id=5173025&host=hh.ru","trusted":true},"published_at":"2021-11-12T17:38:05+0300","created_at":"2021-11-12T17:38:05+0300","negotiations_url":null,"suitable_resumes_url":null,"apply_alternate_url":"https://hh.ru/applicant/vacancy_response?vacancyId=49589181","has_test":false,"test":null,"alternate_url":"https://hh.ru/vacancy/49589181","working_days":[],"working_time_intervals":[],"working_time_modes":[],"accept_temporary":false}

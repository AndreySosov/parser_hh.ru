There is special demand for those kinds of tools for data science, data engineering, and data analytics teams inside an organization.<br />A web-based collaborative tool for working with scientific notebooks, Datalore addresses these needs by providing data scientists with a high-quality code editing experience inside notebooks in a browser, comparable to what is offered by JetBrains desktop IDEs. This is combined with first-class collaboration and visual features, which together make it possible to do data analysis and data science work with as little code as possible.</p> <p>On the server side, we use Kotlin, Java, and a little bit of Python inside a scalable, distributed web application built on Kubernetes. On the frontend, we also use Kotlin and Java, transpiled by TeaVM into JavaScript. We are constantly experimenting with new technologies in order to improve the development experience.</p> <p>We are looking for a software developer who will help us make Datalore even better.</p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p> <ul> <li>At least 3 years of development experience in industry or research</li> <li>Programming experience in Kotlin, Java, C#, or any other statically typed languages such as Scala, Haskell, etc.</li> <li>Knowledge of data structures and algorithms</li> <li>Experience with distributed algorithms and systems</li> </ul> <p><strong>Would be a plus:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Interest or experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Data Analytics</li> <li>Experience with Jupyter, Zeppelin, or R Markdown</li> <li>Knowledge of Python, R, or Julia</li> <li>Experience with Spark, Kafka, or Hadoop</li> <li>Experience developing code editors or IDEs</li> <li>Knowledge of AWS technologies</li> <li>Knowledge of Kubernetes</li> <li>Frontend development experience</li> </ul>","branded_description":null,"vacancy_constructor_template":null,"key_skills":[],"accept_handicapped":false,"accept_kids":false,"archived":false,"response_url":null,"specializations":[{"id":"1.221","name":"Программирование, Разработка","profarea_id":"1","profarea_name":"Информационные технологии, интернет, телеком"}],"professional_roles":[{"id":"96","name":"Программист, разработчик"}],"code":null,"hidden":false,"quick_responses_allowed":false,"driver_license_types":[],"accept_incomplete_resumes":false,"employer":{"id":"9281","name":"JetBrains","url":"https://api.hh.ru/employers/9281?host=hh.ru","alternate_url":"https://hh.ru/employer/9281","logo_urls":{"240":"https://hhcdn.ru/employer-logo/1647147.png","original":"https://hhcdn.ru/employer-logo-original/301193.png","90":"https://hhcdn.ru/employer-logo/1647146.png"},"vacancies_url":"https://api.hh.ru/vacancies?employer_id=9281&host=hh.ru","trusted":true},"published_at":"2021-10-31T14:38:13+0300","created_at":"2021-10-31T14:38:13+0300","negotiations_url":null,"suitable_resumes_url":null,"apply_alternate_url":"https://hh.ru/applicant/vacancy_response?vacancyId=49267033","has_test":false,"test":null,"alternate_url":"https://hh.ru/vacancy/49267033","working_days":[],"working_time_intervals":[],"working_time_modes":[],"accept_temporary":false}

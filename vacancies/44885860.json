Our team believes that the world becomes ever-more connected and interdependent. The borders that prevent people from trading, working together, and exchanging knowledge and innovations erode over time. That is the future we want to live in. Our mission is to speed up the pace at which that happens, building the best platform for Connected Translation. We don’t believe automation will render language professionals obsolete. Instead, we place powerful software into the hands of the millions of people working to globalize their own industries, plug them into our global supply network, and enable continuous delivery of multilingual content. With tens of thousands of customers and hundreds of thousands of freelancers translating together on Smartcat, we are well on our way.</p> <p><strong>Design at Smartcat</strong></p> <p>The Design team works across many types of product initiatives at Smartcat — from our brand voice and websites to events, web and mobile products, primary qualitative and quantitative research, and even printed publications.

All today’s megatrends — big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning — are converging in it at lightning speed. Smartcat’s disruptive business model taps into this $50b industry with a market network where buyers and suppliers connect, collaborate, and leverage our free-to-use workflow SaaS.

This helps us innovate at a fast pace and learn from top professionals in other industries.</p> </li> <li> <p>We are looking for someone who will become a part of the executive team and play a critical role in the most exciting part of our journey from a post-Series B startup to a company exceeding $1b in GMV. Our journey isn’t for the faint of heart. You need to be an extremely fast learner to bring value to our users and the industry as a whole. You need to see the big picture and execute strategies that significantly increase shareholder value over time. We need a sharp mind who can stay two steps ahead on the road with us.

Employees are encouraged to think openly about problems, balancing intellectualism and practicality. Excellent ideas come from anyone, anywhere. Employees are inspired to challenge conventional thinking and possess a mentality of continuous improvement. That’s a key ingredient in remaining a leader in any industry.</p> <p>Our goal is to hire the best and the brightest. We value intellectual horsepower first and foremost, and people who demonstrate an outstanding talent. There is no roadmap to future success, so we need people who can help us build it. Our collective intelligence will drive us there.</p> <p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong> Research is at the core of WorldQuant. Through meticulous exploration and unconstrained thinking about how to apply data to the financial markets, our researchers are in constant search of new alphas. We strive to understand data in ways our competitors don’t believe is possible. Researchers at WorldQuant employ tested processes seeking to identify high-quality predictive signals that we believe are undiscovered by the wider market. These signals are mathematical expressions of data that are used as inputs in our quantitative models.</p> <p>WorldQuant is seeking an outstanding individual to join the firm as a Senior Quantitative Researcher. The person must have a strong understanding of the investment research process to build computer-based models that seek to predict movements of global financial markets.

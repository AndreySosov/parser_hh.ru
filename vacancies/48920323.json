Our mission is to empower the forgotten four billion unbanked and underbanked around the world to have control of their money using peer-to-peer transactions. Born in <strong>2015</strong>, we have over <strong>4.5 million</strong> users globally who you can instantly buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) with over <strong>300</strong> different payment methods.</p> <p><strong>Projects:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Historically Paxful P2P Marketplace was built as a monolith adding more and more features into the same codebase. At some moment we came to the decision to start splitting monolith and creating microservices. The goal of the team is to provide microservices which enable development of new products outside of monolith without a need to have coupling with it. It&#39;s a long complex project continuously bringing new challenges to the team from different sides: authorization, integration between services, data synchronization, independency from 3rd-party services, transparent navigation, etc.</li> <li>One of key roles of Paxful while building P2P marketplace is to provide guarantees to the customers. To support the customers we have a department resolving not only standard issue like problems working on the site but also ability to create and resolve disputes if something goes as not expected during trading on the platform. To provide great service with high SLA we build our own backoffice with great and fast UX, helpers based on ML and other tooling. The team works closely with internal customers to automate routine operations and optimize business processes.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>What we appreciate:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>An open mind</strong>: We believe that change and new ideas are not possible without mistakes and the will to make a product better by fixing them.</li> <li><strong>Proactive attitude</strong>: We’re willing and ready to roll up our sleeves and take responsibility.</li> <li><strong>Accountability</strong>: As colleagues, we take care of each other and help to achieve the best results.</li> <li><strong>Self-direction</strong>: We figure out solutions on our own and take charge of carrying them out.</li> <li><strong>An adaptive mindset</strong>: We shift our processes, perspectives, and working styles along with the environment.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Sounds like a fit?

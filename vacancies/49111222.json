Our New Method takes our portfolio of patented technologies created in-house, and combines it with assembly in Arrival Microfactories. It’s a groundbreaking approach, leading to products with maximum functionality, peak efficiency, and an elevated experience – at a much more competitive price than other electric vehicles, and even fossil fuel vehicles.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Currently we are looking for a <strong>C/C++ Developer to work in Roborace team on Metaverse platform.</strong></p> <p>Metaverse is a complex system of distributed software and hardware components interconnected by low-latency connectivity protocols into a real-time data network where information about real and virtual objects, events and conditions is mediated through a shared “world model”. These components work as plug-in infusers attached to control data and sensor systems of the machines thus making them “metaversed” by seamlessly infusing the data that represents virtual objects, conditions and events into normal control and sensor data, so the machines perceive these simulated virtual elements as real along with real elements of the underlying actual physical processes.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Design &amp; Development of the vehicle models</li> <li>Design &amp; Development of the various vehicle sensors: RADAR, LIDAR, cameras, Ultrasonic, Infrared etc.</li> <li>System performance analysis</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>To qualify, we <strong>expect </strong>the candidate to have:</p> <ul> <li>3+ years of professional development experience with C++</li> <li>3+ years of experience with physics modeling software development: rigid body physics, aerodynamics</li> <li>Knowledge of Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&amp;A) software, tools, and techniques</li> <li>Experience with distributed software systems development</li> <li>Classic algorithms and data structures</li> <li>Knowledge of English at the Upper-intermediate+ level (B2)</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Preferable if you have:</p> <ul> <li>Familiarity with publish/subscribe architecture pattern and its implementations such as DDS</li> <li>Experience with game development and relevant frameworks/engines/libraries</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>At Arrival we want all of our employees to feel comfortable bringing their passion, creativity and individuality to work.
